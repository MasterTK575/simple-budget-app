Create a Category class that is able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food or clothing. Also has to have various amounts of methods.
Besides the Category class, create a function (outside of the class) called create_spend_chart that takes a list of categories as an argument. It should return a string that is a bar chart.

Process:
    1. Create the Category class that can take various instances
    2. Create the deposit
    3. Create the get_balance method (bc. withdraw methods needs to know the balance)
    4. Create the withdraw method

What I've learned:
    1. How to create classes in python
    2. How to use the constructor method to assign characteristics
    3. How to make methods for classes (and remembering to use self to refer to the instance)
    4. How to use methods inside methods/functions to make the code look cleaner and simpler
    5. Using lists, tuples and dictionaries; indexing lists and tuples to find values; finding keys in dictionaries
    6. How to aling strings; How to limit strings; How to limit decimal places for floats
