Create a Category class that is able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food or clothing. Also has to have various amounts of methods.
Besides the Category class, create a function (outside of the class) called create_spend_chart that takes a list of categories as an argument. It should return a string that is a bar chart.

Process:
    1. Create the Category class that can take various instances
    2. Create the deposit and withdraw methods
    3. create the get_balance method

    1. How to create classes in python
    2. How to make methods for classes
